# Timer Program in C++

## Description

This C++ program implements a simple timer functionality where the user can input minutes and seconds, and then a countdown timer is displayed until the time elapses.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of seconds (0-59) and minutes (0-59) for the timer.
3. The program will display the countdown timer in the format `0:minutes:seconds`.
4. The timer will count down every second until it reaches 0.
5. After the timer ends, the program will display a message indicating the end of the timer and the duration it ran for in seconds.

## Code Explanation

- The program uses two `do-while` loops to validate user input for seconds (0-59) and minutes (0-59).
- It calculates the total time in seconds based on user input.
- The countdown timer is implemented using a `for` loop that decrements from the total time to 0.
- Inside the loop, the screen is cleared (`system("cls")`) to update the timer display.
- The countdown logic adjusts minutes and seconds accordingly.
- The loop waits for 1 second (`system("TIMEOUT 1")`) before updating the timer display again.
- After the timer ends, a message is displayed indicating the end of the timer and its duration in seconds.
